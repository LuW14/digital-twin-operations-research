> What is not considered by these individual efforts is a comprehensive integration of best-physics models across disciplines. If those best-physics (i.e., the most accurate, physically realistic and robust) models can be integrated, they will form a basis for certification of vehicles by simulation and real-time, continuous, health management of those vehicles during their missions. They will form the foundation of a NASA digital twin. <font color=purple>@TAG modeling; domain knowledge</font>
> - One application of the digital twin is to fly the actual vehicle’s future mission(s) before its launch.
> - A second application is to mirror the actual flight of its flying twin.
> - A third application is to perform in-situ forensics in the event of a potentially catastrophic fault or damage.
> - A fourth application is to serve as a platform where the effects of modifications to mission parameters, not considered during the design phase of the flying twin, can be studied.

> The framework includes a definition of an object-oriented (O-O) architecture for DTs that incorporates the bottom-up knowledge gained from practical development and implementation of today’s DT classes, while addressing requirements such as re-usability, extensibility, interoperability, interchangeability and autonomy incurred by SM trends and the ultimate SM vision. 
> - A common element of most DT solutions today is the use of a wide variety of models and analytics
>   - the developed solutions provide directed intelligence of a specific type in a specific context area utilizing specific data and behavior.
> 	- This usually means that a method of DT maintenance must be part of the solution, and this method must support an update of the DT intelligence to under- stand and adapt to changes in the application environment [46], [47].
>  	- Most of the DTs in use in factory operation are dedicated DTs, each with a specific purpose such as predict- ing remaining useful life or optimizing product quality. ("closed-loop")
> - One important gap is that most DT approaches today lack mechanisms that convey elements of prediction quality, such as prediction uncertainty and model accuracy, with respect to the application environment.

> Gaps and opportunities: <font color=purple>@TAG inter-operability; modeling</font>
> - Improving integrability, interoperability and inter-changeability of objects within the DT through definition of the interaction between models and with the computational engine in the DT object
> - Improving interoperability, interchangeability, reusability, etc. of DTs throughout the entire DT lifecycle with detailed specifications for support of the DT at each stage of the lifecycle and its transition between these stages.
> - Improving interoperability between DT and non-DT components with specifications that define the interaction between the DT service and clients to deliver the DT capability in an increasingly flexible environment.
> - Improving the maintainability component of the DT life-cycle with methods and specifications for DT maintenance as part of lifecycle on-line (e.g., model tuning), as well as off-line (e.g., model rebuilding) activities [30], [46]. Generally speaking, automation of the on-line maintenance capability should be supported today, while automation of the off-line capability is a longer-term objective (see below).
> - Automating all aspects of the DT lifecycle. The proliferation of and increased reliance on DTs across the entire manufacturing ecosystem eventually will require automation across most stages of the DT lifecycle, from design through maintenance. <font color=green>@RQ Many of the lifecycle steps such as evaluation and on-line maintenance are already automated in some applications, however automation of other stages, such as design, development, V&V and off-line rebuilding represent ongoing technical challenges. Additionally, automation of SME-to-analytics interaction in the various stages of the DT lifecycle will be required [4], [6].</font>
> - Accommodating analytical trends in DT technology. The analytics frontier is dynamic and unpredictable. Evolutionary and revolutionary (disruptive) technologies must be accommodated, or, at minimum, any DT framework should not prevent the use of these technologies. <font color=green>@RQExpected directions in this space include the move towards less narrow context-restricted solutions (e.g., AGI), and more automation of the role of analytics throughout the DT lifecycle.</font>

> Through in-depth analysis, conclusion can be drawn that the connotation of digital twin concept includes:
> - Individualized: This means that digital twin is one-to-one with the individual physical twin. In other words, digital twin is as designed, as manufactured, as used, as maintained as the physical twin.
> - High-fidelity: This means that digital twin can simulate the physical twin’s behavior in the virtual space as exact as possible, which requires multi-physics modeling and continuous model updating through the whole lifecycle.
> - Real-time: This means that digital twin responds to physical twin with relatively low latency, which is made possible by current development of mobile communication technology and IoT technology.
> - Controllable: This means that changes on digital twin or physical twin control the other twin. This is the last step that closes the loop between digital twin and physical twin and realizes digital-physical convergence.

> Two common methods can be used to gather data from physical devices, i.e., capturing changes and taking snapshots. There is extensive use in large scale computer systems for both methods, and sometimes a system uses a mix of them. Both methods need to be validated for specific application cases.
> Digital Twin model version management. A Digital Twin model can evolve over time as a result of engineering changes to its physical counterpart, changes to the modelling interests throughout the lifecycle of the physical counterpart, or other cases. In these cases, the different versions of a Digital Twin models over time should be captured, stored and integrated. Snapshot-based and change-based version management principles can be applied for the effective management different versions of a Digital Twin model.

> However, the current approaches still focus on the development of a general framework or modelling technology for digital twin towards smart manufacturing, which ignores the importance of knowledge for supporting autonomous operations of digital twin.

> Three key enabling technologies including digital twin model, dynamic knowledge bases and knowledge-based intelligent skills for supporting the above strategy are analysed, which equip KDTMC with the capacities of self-thinking, self-decision-making, self-execution and self-improving.

> Note that an offline digital twin describes the case where real-time communication is not critical. Rather, an offline digital twin would connect to the physical system periodically. This periodic connection is an important distinction between an offline digital twin and a traditional simulation model.

> - With reference to processes, experts pointed out issues with process integration as a barrier to implementation.
> - Concerning people and competence, experts pointed out that employees with missing qualifications, and the people’s resistance to change, are barriers to successful implementations of the digital twin.

> A first important set of features of the definition of the DTs must be emphasized.
> - A DT strictly refers to a PO.
> - A DT contains all the information needed to fully characterize a PO and its intended or predicted behavior.
> - Since the DT is framed in a lifecycle composed of different steps, it can encompass data and information that describe the “history” of the PO. (Design, production, operations, disposal)

> This linkage between the PO and the LO is also a key element for introducing new capabilities and thus new business opportunities for the industry.

> Agents typically operate in complex systems that are difficult to model. Agents try to apply strategies of different complexity in order to achieve their goals in a constrained software environment. They can put in practice different local actions in order to inter- act with other agents or with the environment to accommodate their needs. Many agents, especially cognitive ones, are autonomous and operate in a decentralized manner. <font color=purple>@TAG modeling</font>

> It is important to look at three relevant issues that may arise in the application of the DT in large open systems. <font color=purple>@TAG modeling; inter-operability</font>
> - 1) Knowledge of the physical world: It is a daunting task to determine and to describe the models, laws and effects of the real world in an LO. A deeper com- prehension of the physical environments in which the PO will operate can be difficult to realize and to represent in a virtual environment.<font color=purple>@TAG modeling</font>
> - 2) Large systems and products may need to represent a considerable number of parts and their dynamic behavior. Their descriptions and status changes could introduce a higher level of complexity.
> - 3) Siloing/programming: If proprietary and closed interfaces are used, it will be extremely difficult to create ecosystems of DTs capable of working together and being interoperable.

> Characterizing DT
> - Representativeness and Contextualization. Modeling of the DT is still a difficult task; however, practical methodologies are emerging [
> - Reflection
> - Replication. This is the general ability to replicate an object into a different environment. Each replica can be tailored to the needs of the requesting application. Replicas can also cooperate to share data and information about the PO quickly and efficiently. 
> - Entanglement. This communication relationship is termed here entanglement because it refers to the instantaneous exchange of information between two closely related entities... The exchange of information between PO and the LO should be timely, that is, in such a way that the time between the changes of states of the PO is negligible with respect to the needs and intended usage of the LO by applications or users. <font color=purple>@TAG synchronization frequency; real-time optimization</font>
> - Persistency. While all of these mechanisms ensure the high persistency of objects and memory in large distributed systems, they do introduce the issues of managing different copies and their consistency. <font color=purple>@TAG synchronization frequency; real-time optimization</font> (Case in the Section V-A, virtual sensors)
> - Memorization. <font color=green>@RQ The DT concept brings with it an important issue: how much of the complex context in which the PO is immersed should be considered by the digital copy? What are the relevant data to be stored? If the object (e.g., the cloverleaf) is going to be used for a specific goal (feeding some animals), how much should it be contextualized with respect to the envisaged application of the DT? Should the entire context of a PO be recreated and represented? In principle, the DT should keep a set of all the meaningful data together with their location and time indication.</font>
> - Composability. Supporting component integration and communication. The efforts related to virtualization also offer mechanisms and technologies for supporting the composability property of the DT: microservices [149] and containers [150] are possible candidates for supporting the integration and composition of several LOs. Simulation theory [152] and agent-based simulation technologies [72], [153] for large systems also play a key role in representing the behavior of a large system composed of different DTs... Some middleware platforms for DT are developed [31], [156] and are aiming at composability.
> - Accountability/Manageability. Auto Digital Twin maintenance.
> - Augmentation. it could be functionally augmented, that is, new functions and features could be implemented in the LO. New features are software-based and take the form of innovative and more intelligent functions enabled by APIs or by the analysis of data sets related to the PO....The possibility of defining platform mechanisms to support the creation of services is also discussed in [177].
> - Ownership. Their replication can create a set of LOs that refer to the physical one, but they not necessarily share the same ownership.
> - Servitization. A permanent linkage between the customer and the producer is then established by means of the ownership of the servitized product. Servitization is a great possibility for transforming existing and future products into services appealing to customers. In the long term, servitization could lead to a new kind of economy no longer based on the ownership of things, but based on a pay per usage philosophy.
> - Predictability

> Typical scenarios for the usage of the DT
> - Design and consolidation of products, that is, where the DT is used to help in the design and the production phases of complex products and then used as a means to collect and check the operation of the product in order to identify variations or unexpected behavior.
> - Prediction and simulation of the behavior of an aggregated set of DTs in order to understand, con- trol, govern, and orchestrate the behavior of a complex system. This is supported by the collection of historical data that show the past behavior of the PO.
> - Servitization of a physical product and its augmentation in terms of new functions and interaction with the customers.

> This requires a good set of modeling capabilities as well as the ability to fully understand the constraints and limitation of the POs and the environment in which they operate. The object, or a set of objects, and the environment in which they will operate should be modeled in an autonomous fashion. <font color=purple>@TAG modeling</font>

> The most tangible value of a large DT implementation may reside in the possibility to observe, analyze, and understand real-world interactions and impacts on differ- ent objects at a very granular level.

> Following this analogy, DT may not be the right choice if the problem at hand has a very procedural solution, or if it can be solved in a functional way.

>A digital twin is a virtual representation of real-world entities and processes, synchronized at a specified frequency and fidelity. 
> - Digital twin systems transform business by accelerating holistic understanding, optimal decision-making, and effective action.
> - Digital twins use real-time and historical data to represent the past and present and simulate predicted futures.
> - Digital twins are motivated by outcomes, tailored to use cases, powered by integration, built on data, guided by domain knowledge, and implemented in IT/OT systems.

>The foundational elements of the definition are captured in the first sentence: the virtual representation, the real-world entities and processes it represents, and the mechanism by which the virtual and real-world entities are synchronized.

2. **How Digital Twins Enable Holistic Understanding**. The Digital Twin Consortium, 2021. [article](https://blog.digitaltwinconsortium.org/2021/01/how-digital-twins-enable-holistic-understanding.html)

> The five key components required to achieve holistic value with a digital twin are: 
> - Data connections, such as IoT sensors and enterprise design and operational data, to enable real-world synchronization 
> - Descriptive models to accurately inform, monitor and react 
> - Predictive models, such as Simulation or Machine learning to anticipate situations and provide awareness of the evolution of a system
> - Common ontologies and a common modeling language to guarantee consistency
> - Analytics services to detect trends and anomalies, trigger user notifications, test alternative scenarios and robustness, optimize levers, and control automation.

> In addition, there are three key enablers that contribute to delivering this holistic value, namely:
> - High scalability of components to scale to the system level
> - High performance to synchronize with the real-world systems, predict and act in real-time
> - Capacity to twin a complex system composed of heterogeneous and interconnected components.

3. **The Case for the Digital Thread**. The Digital Twin Consortium, 2021. [article](https://blog.digitaltwinconsortium.org/2020/12/the-case-for-the-digital-thread.html)

> Digital Twin Consortium defines the digital thread as a mechanism for correlating information across multiple dimensions of the virtual representation, where the dimensions include (but are not limited to) time or lifecycle stage (including design intent), kind-of-model, and configuration history; the mechanism generally relies on stable, consistent real-world identifiers

> Five steps can increase the value of your digital twin by containing the cost of implementation.
> - Provide standards from an owner’s perspective
> - Identify opportunities to do once and deploy many times 
> - Enable a digital thread through all processes and phases - Assess and understand all the components and processes that contribute to the value chain and package them in an integrated manner rather than allowing the current silos apparent in all organizations to propagate and strengthen. Collaboration cannot flourish in a siloed organization but a requirement to implement a digital thread will quickly confront the silos and enable efficiencies in the organization.
> - Configure systems to support the digital thread
> - Provide supervision to enable the digital thread 

4. **Transforming Businesses using Digital Twin**. The Digital Twin Consortium, 2021. [article](https://blog.digitaltwinconsortium.org/2021/01/transforming-businesses-using-digital-twin-.html)
> Each system brings its own blind spots, but a digital twin system can integrate them to cover each others’ blind spots and yield a comprehensive view.

> The mirrored world is the amalgamation of these threads; as more enterprises build and connect intelligent twins, bringing more of their organization into digital space, they are opening a cornucopia of new opportunities and ways of doing business. 

> Leaders will be able to make data and intelligence the primary orchestrators of the business, increasing real-time agility at scale, overhauling their innovation processes, and forming entirely new mirrored-world ecosystems and partnerships.

> Many organizations struggled because they couldn’t easily answer these big-picture queries....Bringing data and intelligence together at this magnitude is what makes building intelligent twins and the mirrored world so critical. They will let enterprises ask and answer big-picture questions: How will it impact my operations if I have to shutter this warehouse? What will happen if this vendor’s supply chain fails? How can I update this product to be more sustainable—and is that achievable with my existing vendors?

> When intelligent twins are connected in mirror environments, they are a powerful way
to turn data into actionable, big-picture insights. But incomplete or incorrect data will lead to false conclusions. ... High-quality historic data is critical for intelligent twins—it’s what the twin uses to monitor real-time machine performance, build models of customer behavior to help design custom products, and more...Going forward, enterprises cannot rely on historic data blindly—they need to check and correct their models as the world changes.
> ... the tools to prepare, analyze, and visualize the massive amounts of information gathered. Today, many enterprises are already investing in IoT devices and sensors, but struggle to fully utilize the data these devices generate. 
<font color=purple>@TAG data quality; integration of data and intelligence</font>

> They are, essentially, a risk-free playground to explore new product ideas, strategize for many possible futures, and explore limitless “what-if” scenarios. Most businesses experimenting with this kind of simulation today are doing so at a smaller scale, but the capabilities they are demonstrating will only become more valuable when enterprises can tap into multiple twins in fully mirrored environments.

> Have ecosystem-scale thinking lead digital twin strategies.Target large systems as the long-term target digital twins. Think entire offices, supply chains, and more. Use individual twins as a means to gain greater visibility into larger collaborations.

> 18% (24%) of the organization are scaling up or experimenting the technology of digital twins with this year.

> 65% of executives expect their organization’s investment in intelligent digital twins to increase over the next three years

> Only 11% of executives estimate that 100 percent of the data provided through IoT devices and/or sensors in their organizations is fully utilized.
