> Almost all developed countries have grappled with the trade-offs between open access to information—which enables economic efficiency—and an individual’s right to privacy. Consistent with these trade-offs, many recent incidents suggest that regulatory approaches to information privacy, corporate management of personal data, and consumer reactions are becoming tightly interwoven around the world. To provide some insights into these relationships, we develop a conceptual model and test it with a cross-cultural sample from 19 different countries.

> Findings: a country’s regulatory approach to the corporate management of information privacy is affected by its cultural values and by individuals’ information privacy concerns.

2. **The Short-Run Effects of the General Data Protection Regulation on Technology Venture Investment**. Marketing Science, 2021. [paper](https://doi.org/10.1287/mksc.2020.1271). *Jian Jia, Ginger Zhe Jin, Liad Wagman*

> The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was enacted in the European Union in April 2016 and went into effect in May 2018. We study its impact on investment in new and emerging technology firms. Our findings indicate negative post-GDPR effects after its 2018 rollout on European ventures relative to their counterparts in the United States and the rest of the world, and considerably lesser effects after its 2016 enactment and before implementation. The negative effects manifest in the number of and amounts raised in financing deals, and are particularly pronounced for newer, data-related, and business- to-consumer ventures.

> There appear to be at least two broad categories for how the GDPR can affect business. The first includes costs related to adjusting a firm’s business model such that it meets regulatory requirements. The second includes potential reductions in longer-term profitability because of costs related to maintaining different systems, higher fines, or the inability to extract the same amount of value as in the pre-GDPR regime.

> This study presents an analysis of the impact of the GDPR on new technology venture investment in the EU.

> B2B deals, in comparison, did not significantly change after the GDPR’s enactment but decreased by 10.8% following its rollout. The difference between B2C and B2B ventures is potentially because consumer-facing products have more exposure to the regulation, particularly to its requirements concerning individual users (e.g., opt-in or legitimate interest, data management, control, and processing violations, with potential fines per violation).

3. **Against Classification Attacks: A Decision Tree Pruning Approach to Privacy Protection in Data Mining**. Operations Research, 2009. [paper](https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.1090.0702). *Xiao-Bai Li, Sumit Sarkar*

> Data-mining techniques can be used not only to study collective behavior about customers, but also to discover private information about individuals. In this study, we demonstrate that decision trees, a popular classification technique for data mining, can be used to effectively reveal individuals' confidential data, even when the identities of the individuals are not present in the data. We propose a novel approach for organizations to protect confidential data from such a classification attack. The key components of this approach include a set of entropy-based measures to evaluate disclosure risks of individual records, an optimal pruning algorithm to identify high-risk records, and a pair of data-swapping procedures to reduce the disclosure risks. The proposed method provides the best trade-off between data utility and privacy protection against classification attacks. It can be applied to data with both numeric and categorical attributes. An experimental study on six real-world data sets shows that the proposed method is very effective in protecting privacy while enabling legitimate data mining and analysis.
