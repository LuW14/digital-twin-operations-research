# Papers: Digital Twin and Operations Research
We would like to maintain resources that discuss digital twins (DT) and the related issues in operations research (OR). The manuscript can be found on [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348804775_Digital_Twin_What_It_Is_Why_Do_It_and_Research_Opportunities_for_Operations_Research).
